## [Unreleased]

### Breaking changes

#### Entities

- **`spawn_static_entity` removed.** Use `server.spawn_entity(world).as_static()` instead.
  Chain `.as_static()` before the first `.insert_component()` call; calling it after will panic.

#### Resources

- **`insert_static_resource` removed.** The `is_static: bool` parameter is now the third
  argument to `insert_resource`:
  - Dynamic: `server.insert_resource(world, value, false)`
  - Static: `server.insert_resource(world, value, true)`

- **`insert_resource` signature changed.** Previous signature was
  `insert_resource(world, value)` (always dynamic). New signature is
  `insert_resource(world, value, is_static: bool)`.

#### Events

- **`WorldEvents<E>` (client) renamed to `Events<E>`.** Update any type annotations or
  `use` imports that referenced `naia_client::WorldEvents`.

#### Rooms

- **`make_room` renamed to `create_room`.** All call sites must be updated.

#### Count methods

- **`resource_count()` renamed to `resources_count()`.** Noun is now plural, consistent
  with `users_count()` and `rooms_count()`.

- **`room_count()` on `UserRef` renamed to `rooms_count()`.** Same pluralisation rule.

#### Client replication config

- **`ReplicationConfig` enum removed from `naia_client`.** Client code that previously
  imported `naia_client::ReplicationConfig` must now import `naia_client::Publicity`
  (re-exported from `naia_shared`). The variants are unchanged: `Private`, `Public`,
  `Delegated`.

#### Messaging

- **`server.send_message` now returns `Result<(), NaiaServerError>`.** Callers that
  previously ignored the return value silently now receive an error if the user is not
  found.

#### EntityMut

- **`EntityMut::insert_components` (batch variant) removed from the server.** Use
  `insert_component` in a loop instead.

### Added

- **`entity_is_delegated` predicate on `Server<E>`.** Convenience equivalent to
  `server.entity_replication_config(e).map_or(false, |c| c.publicity.is_delegated())`.

- **`EntityMut::as_static()` builder method.** Replaces `spawn_static_entity`. Must be
  called before `insert_component` on entities that should be treated as static.
