One day this will be a cross-platform (including Wasm) Websocket API that wraps unreliable & unordered messages, using WebRTC & UDP.

Planning on utilizing the wonderful https://github.com/kyren/webrtc-unreliable & https://github.com/amethyst/laminar

Any help is very welcome, please get in touch! I'm still quite a Rust noob and this project is pretty intense so I'm open to suggestions/critiques.
